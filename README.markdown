# dm-models

DataMapper Models is an effort to collect reusable and relatively stable model classes which can be integrated into other applications.  This project was set up as a shared repository for utility models, educational code demonstrating particular DM features, and as a common basis for fixtures for DataMapper related projects.  Please remember that contributions can either be in the form of a model class, or could be properties and functions contained within a mixin module.
